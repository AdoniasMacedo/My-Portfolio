        The environment-changing system is a powerful tool that can enhance the immersion and interactivity of Roblox games. By using the ZonePlus module, developers can create zones within their game world that trigger specific events or changes in the environment when a player enters or exits them. For example, a dark and ominous forest could suddenly become bright and sunny when a player exits the forest zone and enters a meadow zone. This system can be adapted to many situations, from weather effects and lighting changes to triggering special events and cutscenes. In this particular example, I used an atmospheric component to change the environment, adding an extra layer of visual and atmospheric detail to the game world.
