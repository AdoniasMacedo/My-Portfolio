        The Daily Reward system is a popular feature in many Roblox games, offering players incentives to return and play the game each day. I have created an example of this system that can be easily adapted for use in a variety of games. With customizable rewards and a user-friendly interface, this system is an effective way to increase player engagement and retention.
