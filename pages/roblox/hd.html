        The fall damage system is a crucial feature in many Roblox games, particularly those with parkour-style gameplay. This system imposes penalties on players who fall from great heights, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to the game. By incentivizing players to plan their jumps and landings more carefully, the fall damage system can improve overall gameplay and create a more immersive experience for the player.
